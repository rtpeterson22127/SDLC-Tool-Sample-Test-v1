## Life is Vanilla and so is GitHub.

This repository has been created for the sole purpose to learn more about git, github and who knows maybe VCS? (Wouldn't that be something) As discussed in the workshop that we had/are having.
Have fun. Practise a lot. Don't fear to do something wrong or break something.
You will learn more from your mistakes.
Let's go
Also, in what language do deaf people think in? #wokethoughts

Refer the issues, or make an issue yourself if you need help.
