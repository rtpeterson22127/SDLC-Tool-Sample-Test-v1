## Life is Chocolate and so is GitHub.

This repository has been created for the sole purpose to learn more about git, github and VCS. As discussed in the workshop that we had/are having.
Have fun. Practice a lot. Don't fear to do something wrong or break something.
You will learn more from your mistakes.

Refer the issues, or make an issue yourself if you need help.
