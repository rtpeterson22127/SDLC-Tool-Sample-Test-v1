## Life is Chocolate and so is GitHub.
##life is struggle.

This repository has been created for the sole purpose to learn more about git, github and VCS. As discussed in the workshop that we had/are having.
Have fun. Practise a lot. Don't fear to do something wrong or break something.
You will learn more from your mistakes.

Refer the issues, or make an issue yourself if you need help.
